# CalHacks 2022 Project - Fokus

⚡ Welcome to Fokus! ⚡

Fokus is a Chrome extension for studying, focusing, and productivity. As studious Berkeley students in the midst of midterm season, we wanted to create a tool that can help other students study and prepare for their exams!

The extension features a Pomodoro timer as well as a to-do list (keep track of which assignments you need to do). There is also a new inspirational quote featured everyday!
