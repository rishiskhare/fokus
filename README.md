# CalHacks 2022 Project - Fokus

⚡ Welcome to Fokus! ⚡

Fokus is a Chrome extension for studying, focusing, and productivity. As studious Berkeley students in the midst of midterm season, we wanted to create a tool that can help other students study and prepare for their exams!

In the late 1980s Francesco Cirillo developed a time management method known as the Pomodoro Technique in which a kitchen timer is used to break work into intervals of around 20-25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Therefore, one of the main features of our extension is the Pomodoro timer.

Another feature we have included is an editable to-do list - students can add, change, or delete any homework assignments as they please.

There is also a new inspirational quote featured everyday!
